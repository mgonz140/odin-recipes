            <h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol class="centered-list">
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
                <li>Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni 
                    and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will 
                    finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in 
                    flour and stir until the mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded 
                    Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low 
                    heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2 cup more 
                    milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir until well combined.</li>
                <li>Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add bread 
                    crumbs; cook and stir until well coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, 
                    then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, 
                    about 30 minutes.</li>
